Threshold is an innovative wearable device designed to enhance workout performance by detecting muscle failure in real time using an EMG sensor. Equipped with LED indicators and a rest timer, Threshold provides instant feedback to help users optimize their training. By delivering precise, data-driven insights, the device notifies users when they reach their threshold, ensuring they maximize each set and fully utilize their muscle capacity. This results in more effective workouts, improved performance, and safer training sessions.
